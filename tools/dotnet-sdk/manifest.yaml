    dotnet programs require libicu for globalization. To avoid this
    dependency, set the following environment variable before running
    dotnet programs (https://aka.ms/dotnet-missing-libicu):
    
        DOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=1

    To opt out of telemetry, set the following environment variable
    before running dotnet programs (https://aka.ms/dotnet-cli-telemetry):
    
        DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
    
    To set the location of the dotnet SDK, set the following environment
    variable before running dotnet programs:
    
        DOTNET_ROOT=$target/share/dotnet

    With dotnet in a well-known location like /usr or /usr/local and dotnet
    in the PATH, this may not be necessary.
