The container tools installer and updater

⚠️ uniget is in the process of being migrated [to GitLab](https://gitlab.com/uniget-org). The migration is being tracked [here](https://gitlab.com/uniget-org/migration-gh2gl). There is only one thing, you need to do: regularly update the uniget CLI using `uniget self-update`. ⚠️
